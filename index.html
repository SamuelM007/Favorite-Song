            Return of the Mack, get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is,
            what it isn't
          </li>
          <li>Looking for a better way to get up out of bed</li>
          <li>Instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit</li>
          <li>We get up, fresh out, pimp strut walking</li>
          <li>Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious</li>
          <li>Somewhere between like, Rocky and Cosby, sweater game</li>
          <li>Nope, nope, y'all can't copy that</li>
          <li>Bad, moonwalking, this here, is our party</li>
          <li>My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way</li>
          <li>
            Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything, I
            record to it
          </li>
          <li>And yet I'm on, let that stage light go and shine on down</li>
          <li>Got the Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style</li>
          <li>Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds</li>
          <li>But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town</li>
          <li>Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustling</li>
          <li>Chasing dreams since I was fourteen</li>
          <li>With the four-track, bussin'</li>
          <li>
            Halfway 'cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crush shit
          </li>
          <li>Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin'</li>
          <li>We give that to the people, spread it across the country</li>
